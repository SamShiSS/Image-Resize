# Image-Resize

This program (resize.c) resizes 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of f, where f is a floating-point value within (0.0, 100.0).

Enter three command-line arguments: the first is resize.c, the second is the name of a BMP to be resized, and the third is the name of the resized version to be written.
